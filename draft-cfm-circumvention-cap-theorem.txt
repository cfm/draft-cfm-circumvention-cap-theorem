1.  Test

   Between June 2022 and April 2023 [tor-status], the Tor network was
   the target of a sustained distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
   attack, apparently targeting the relays and directory servers that
   coordinate introductions to Tor hidden services [tor-relays-2022-07]
   [tor-relays-2022-10].  This attack impeded the performance and
   threatened the security of the Tor network for all users.  It
   especially obstructed Web sites and services that had gone out of
   their way to be accessible to Tor users via Tor hidden services,
   which usually improve the performance of the Tor network by bypassing
   the "exit nodes" that interface with the clearnet Internet.

   Although the origins and motivations of this attack remain unknown,
   it is a useful case study in the D/DoS vulnerability of overlay
   networks such as Tor, which for different users may protect their
   anonymity, circumvent censorship, or both.  The CAP theorem is
   instructive: like a database, a censorship-circumvention system is
   useful to the extent that it is consistent (returns accurate and
   current data), available (returns data at all), and partition-
   tolerant (routes around failures---which by definition include active
   censorship).  D/DoS attacks against the Tor network diminish its
   overall availability, which lessens its utility in circumventing
   other censorship measures whether or not the attack itself is
   motivated by or intended as an act of censorship.
